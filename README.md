![Build & Test (macOS and linux)](https://github.com/laosb/swift-noise/actions/workflows/build+test.yml/badge.svg)

> A Swift implementation of the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html). 

> **A fork 🍴 of [swift-libp2p/swift-noise](https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-noise/tree/main)**
> I forked it because I'm focusing on my use of Noise Protocol Framework.
> The original implementation seem to be tailored to the usage in libp2p, thus requires many modifications for this library to be useful outside of the libp2p ecosystem. Also, the original implementation is all in one huge file, which makes reading & maintaining code miserable. Both factors leads me to believe that my modifications are unlikely to be accepted by the upstream.
> I'm not a cryptography guy - So all my modifications are focused on developer experience and exposing data structures for my own need. The [warning ⚠️](#%EF%B8%8F-warning) from the original author still applies.

## Overview
Noise is a framework for building crypto protocols. Noise protocols support mutual and optional authentication, identity hiding, forward secrecy, zero round-trip encryption, and other advanced features.

### ⚠️ Warning
This package has **NOT** been extensively tested in real world applications and **should NOT be used in production environments**. Although the actual cryptography is handled by swift-crypto, the handshake logic could, and probably does, contain a myriad of bugs. Please feel free to look over the code and submit improvements where you see fit.  

#### Note:

## Install

Include the following dependency in your Package.swift file
```Swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(name: "Noise", url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-noise.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
    ],
        ...
        .target(
            ...
            dependencies: [
                ...
                .product(name: "Noise", package: "swift-noise"),
            ]),
        ...
    ...
)
```

## Usage

### Example 
check out the [tests](https://github.com/SwiftEthereum/Noise/tree/main/Tests/NoiseTests) for more examples

```Swift

import Noise

/// Instantiate an instance on the client side
let initiator = try Noise.HandshakeState(config:
    Noise.Config(
        cipherSuite: Noise.CipherSuite(
            keyCurve: .ed25519,
            cipher: .ChaChaPoly1305,
            hashFunction: .sha256
        ),
        handshakePattern: Noise.Handshakes.XX,
        initiator: true,
        prologue: [],
        presharedKey: nil,
        staticKeypair: initiatorsStatic,
        ephemeralKeypair: initiatorsEphemeral
    )
)
   
/// Instantiate an instance on the host side
let responder = try Noise.HandshakeState(config:
    Noise.Config(
        cipherSuite: Noise.CipherSuite(
            keyCurve: .ed25519,
            cipher: .ChaChaPoly1305,
            hashFunction: .sha256
        ),
        handshakePattern: Noise.Handshakes.XX,
        initiator: false,
        prologue: [],
        presharedKey: nil,
        staticKeypair: respondersStatic,
        ephemeralKeypair: respondersEphemeral
    )
)


/// On the client / initiator side

// Kick off the handshake by generating the first message
let (msgInit1, _, _) = try initiator.writeMessage(payload: []) // -> Yeilds the first payload to be sent to the host / responder

// ... wait for the response, then consume it
let (decryptedMessage2Payload, _, _) = try initiator.readMessage(responseFromHost) // -> Yeilds a decrypted payload if one was sent...

// Write the next message
let (msgInit3, initCS1, initCS2) = try initiator.writeMessage(payload: []) // -> Depending on the handshake chosen, you'll have your CipherStates available at this point

/// Handshake is completed on initiators end at this point...
/// After the handshake is completed, you'll have access to two CipherStates (one for inbound decryption and one for outbound encryption)

// You can start sending encrypted messages now...
let secureMessage1 = try initCS1!.encrypt(plaintext: "My Message".data(using: .utf8)!)

// And decrypting inbound messages using the second CipherState
let decryptedInboundMessage = try initCS2!.decrypt(ciphertext: encryptedInboundMessage)



/// On the host / responder side

// Read the first message from the initiator...
let (decryptedMessage1Payload, _, _) = try responder.readMessage(firstMessageFromInitiator) // -> Yeilds a decrypted payload, if one was sent... 

// Respond
let (msgResp2, _, _) = try responder.writeMessage(payload: []) // -> Yeilds the response message to be sent back to the initiator

// ... wait for the response from the initiator, then consume it
let (decryptedMessage3Payload, respCS1, respCS2) = try responder.readMessage(responseFromInitiator) // -> Depending on the handshake chosen, you'll have your CipherStates available at this point

/// Handshake is complete at this point...
/// After the handshake is completed, you'll have access to two CipherStates (one for inbound decryption and one for outbound encryption)

// You can start sending encrypted messages now...
let secureMessage1 = try respCS1!.encrypt(plaintext: "My Message".data(using: .utf8)!)

// And decrypting inbound messages using the second CipherState
let decryptedInboundMessage = try respCS2!.decrypt(ciphertext: encryptedInboundMessage)


```
